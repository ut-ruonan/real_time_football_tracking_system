# Real-Time Football Tracking System

## Overview

This project implements a real-time tracking system for football (soccer) players, aimed at providing precise player positioning data for analysis. The system processes video footage to detect and track movements on the field using advanced computer vision techniques.

## Features
- **Player Detection**: Identifies and tracks individual players on the field.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Operates in real-time, allowing live analysis during matches.
- **Data Export**: Outputs player positions for further statistical analysis.

## Example Output

## Future Work

- **Improved Accuracy**: Implement more advanced models to enhance tracking precision.
- **Multi-Camera Support**: Extend the system to combine data from multiple camera angles for better coverage.
- **Live Streaming**: Enable the system to integrate with live video feeds for real-time broadcast.
